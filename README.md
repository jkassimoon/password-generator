* ## Project Description

For this project, we generated a password that fits the user's criteria in four categories: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once the user selects a criteria, the password must absolutely include that character in the final password (i.e. user selects "lowercase letters and numbers" then the final password will never not have just numbers). The final password is displayed in a text box.

* ## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project.

* ## Challenges

For me personally the biggest challenge is re-learning all my old codes I used to know, such as using "querySelector" instead of "getElementById". I also had a misunderstanding of how Math.random worked so that resulted in the final code having an issue reaching outside of the array and having an "undefined" alphanumeric/special character.
